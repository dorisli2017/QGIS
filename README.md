# QGIS:

## Our algorithms
 simple[weighted/ stable]( corresponds to the algorithm Greedy in our paper)
 mis [weighted/ stable]
 kamis [unweighted/unstable] (see http://algo2.iti.kit.edu/kamis/)
 maxHS [weighted/ stable]

## to discuss
weight of label l of feature f: InactiveCost(f) - cost(l) [may not proper]
In qgis, point features normally have only one label candidate (8 positions for region) [may define our preferences ourselves]


## further improvements
reimplemantaion of pal (directed in qgis with qgsfeature and qgslabling)
modification and update in problem implemented (Now modificatiopn emits new layout and builds new problem)
